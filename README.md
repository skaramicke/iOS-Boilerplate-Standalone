What is IOS Boilerplate Standalone
----------------------------------

Based on iOS Boilerplate, striving to provide standalone click-and-drag components that can easily be implemented in any other Xcode project.

Using iOS Boilerplate on a regular basis, I found myself always complaining about all the requirements the different objects have. This project will eleviate that problem for me.
